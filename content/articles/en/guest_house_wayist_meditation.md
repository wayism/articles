### The Guest House: by Rumi

This being human is a guest house.<br>
Every morning a new arrival.<br>
A joy, a depression, a meanness,<br>
some momentary awareness comes<br>
as an unexpected visitor.<br>
<br>
Welcome and entertain them all!<br>
Even if they're a crowd of sorrows,<br>
who violently sweep your house<br>
empty of its furniture,<br>
still, treat each guest honorably.<br>
He may be clearing you out<br>
for some new delight.<br>
<br>
The dark thought, the shame, the malice,<br>
meet them at the door laughing,<br>
and invite them in.<br>
<br>
Be grateful for whoever comes,<br>
because each has been sent<br>
as a guide from beyond.<br>
<br>
*~ Rumi (translated by Coleman Barks)*
<br>

## A Different Path to Stillness

While many meditation traditions focus on emptying the mind or achieving a state of blank awareness, Wayist practice takes a different approach. Like the 13th-century Persian poet Rumi, we understand that true spiritual growth comes not from pushing away our thoughts and emotions, but from developing a contemplative relationship with them.

Rumi's "The Guest House" perfectly captures this Wayist understanding. Rather than seeing our mental and emotional states as obstacles to spiritual development, we welcome them as teachers and guides on our path of transformation.

## The Wayist Approach to Meditation

In Wayist spirituality, meditation serves a specific purpose: to cultivate self-awareness that leads to self-craft. We are not seeking to escape from our human experience but to understand it more deeply so we can consciously evolve.

This approach differs significantly from traditions that emphasize:
- Emptying the mind of all thoughts
- Achieving states of pure consciousness
- Transcending human emotions and experiences
- Seeking permanent bliss or peace states

Instead, Wayist meditation focuses on:
- **Active contemplation** of our experiences
- **Self-reflection** to understand our patterns and reactions  
- **Inner listening** to divine guidance through our Tara
- **Mindful awareness** of our multiple minds working together

## The Guest House as Meditation Practice

Rumi's poem offers a practical framework for Wayist contemplative meditation. Each thought, emotion, or experience that arises becomes a "guest" to be acknowledged and examined rather than dismissed.

### Welcoming All Guests

When we sit in meditation or move through our day with meditative awareness, we practice greeting whatever arises with curiosity rather than resistance. A difficult emotion becomes material for self-understanding. An unexpected joy offers insight into what truly nourishes our soul.

This welcoming attitude transforms our relationship with our inner experience. Instead of battling our thoughts or trying to control our emotions, we become interested observers of our own psychological and spiritual processes.

### Honoring Each Visitor

The poem suggests treating each guest "honorably," even those who come with darkness or discomfort. In Wayist practice, this means:

- **Acknowledging** what we're experiencing without judgment
- **Examining** why this particular "guest" has arrived now
- **Learning** what this experience can teach us about ourselves
- **Integrating** the wisdom gained into our ongoing self-craft

### The Clearing Function

Perhaps most importantly, Rumi recognizes that difficult experiences often serve a clearing function. They "violently sweep your house empty of its furniture" to make space for "some new delight."

This aligns perfectly with the Wayist understanding that challenges and discomforts often indicate areas where our soul programming needs updating. What we resist or find most disturbing often points to exactly what we need to examine and transform.

## Practical Application

### Daily Guest House Meditation

**Morning Practice** (5-10 minutes):
1. Sit quietly and notice what "guests" have arrived in your awareness today
2. Instead of pushing away uncomfortable feelings or thoughts, greet them with curiosity
3. Ask each guest: "What are you here to teach me?"
4. Thank each visitor for its potential wisdom

**Evening Reflection** (10-15 minutes):
1. Review the day's experiences as various "guests" that visited your inner house
2. Notice which ones you welcomed easily and which ones you resisted
3. Reflect on what each experience might be teaching you about yourself
4. Consider how your reactions reveal patterns in your soul programming

### Working with Difficult Guests

When challenging emotions or thoughts arise:

**Instead of:** "I shouldn't feel this way" or "I need to stop thinking about this"

**Try:** "This feeling/thought has come as a teacher. What is it trying to show me about myself?"

**Follow up with contemplative questions:**
- "Which of my chakra minds is generating this response?"
- "What belief or expectation is creating this reaction?"
- "How might my Tara be using this experience to guide my growth?"
- "What would change in me if I fully learned this lesson?"

## The Attitude of Meditation

This guest house approach exemplifies what Wayists call "the attitude of meditation" - maintaining contemplative awareness throughout daily life rather than limiting spiritual practice to formal sitting sessions.

With this attitude, we remain present and observant as we:
- Navigate workplace challenges
- Experience relationship dynamics  
- Face financial or health concerns
- Encounter unexpected joys or sorrows

Each situation becomes an opportunity for the kind of self-reflection that leads to genuine transformation.

## Beyond Temporary Visitors

While Rumi's poem focuses on welcoming temporary guests, Wayist practice also recognizes that some patterns and tendencies are more like permanent residents that need conscious renovation rather than just acknowledgment.

Through the self-knowledge gained from this contemplative approach, we engage in what we call "self-craft" - the intentional work of reprogramming our soul minds and transforming habitual patterns that no longer serve our spiritual development.

## Community and Guidance

The poem's final line suggests that each experience "has been sent as a guide from beyond." In Wayist understanding, our Divine Tara works through our experiences to provide exactly the learning opportunities we need for our soul's advancement.

This recognition helps us approach even difficult periods with trust rather than victimhood. We're not being punished or abandoned, but carefully guided through a curriculum designed for our spiritual growth.

## Integration with Daily Life

The beauty of this approach is its practical applicability. Whether we're dealing with:
- Workplace frustration
- Family conflicts
- Personal disappointments
- Unexpected opportunities
- Health challenges
- Creative blocks

We can apply the guest house perspective, treating each situation as a teacher rather than an obstacle.

This doesn't mean becoming passive or accepting harmful situations. Rather, it means approaching our circumstances with the kind of self-aware curiosity that enables wise action rather than reactive behavior.

## Conclusion

Rumi's "Guest House" offers modern Wayists a perfect metaphor for contemplative meditation practice. Rather than seeking to escape our human experience, we learn to engage with it more skillfully, treating each thought, emotion, and circumstance as a potential teacher.

This approach honors both our humanity and our spiritual aspirations. We don't need to transcend our psychological complexity to grow spiritually - we need to understand it more deeply and work with it more consciously.

Through this kind of contemplative practice, we develop the self-awareness that makes genuine transformation possible. We become both the observer and the observed, the student and the teacher, the guest house and its welcoming host.

In this way, meditation becomes not an escape from life but a deeper engagement with it - exactly the kind of practical spirituality that serves both our individual development and our capacity to contribute meaningfully to the world around us.
